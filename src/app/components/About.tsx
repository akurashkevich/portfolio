          <p>
            I am a frontend developer with ambitions to become an expert in my
            field. From an early age I was fascinated by technology: I sat down
            at a computer for the first time at the age of 4, started
            programming at 14, and made my first websites in primary school. I
            was involved in sports programming, participated in research
            conferences, project schools and hackathons, which helped me develop
            my analytical thinking, creativity and teamwork skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            My professional interests extend beyond the realm of coding,
            I`&apos;`m passionate about creating products that are not only
            useful and convenient, but also enhance people`&apos;`s lives. I am
            quick learner, easily adaptable to new tasks and willing to learn
            related roles if needed.
